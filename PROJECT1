Perfect! Here is a **FULLY DETAILED, STEP-BY-STEP** version of **PROJECT 1 — Undoing Work & Recovery Lab**, with:

✔ Explanation of every command
✔ What happens internally in Git
✔ Expected output
✔ Mistakes to simulate
✔ How to recover

This becomes your **Git Undoing Work Master Project**.

# 🚀 **PROJECT 1: Undoing Work & Recovery Lab (Highly Detailed)**

You will learn:

* `git reset` (soft, mixed, hard)
* `git restore`
* `git commit --amend`
* `git reflog` (ultimate recovery tool)
* Recover deleted commits
* Recover deleted files
* Undo a wrong commit
* Undo staged files
* Undo only some changes
* Safely vs dangerously undoing work

---

# 📌 **STEP 1 — Create a new lab folder & initialize Git**

```bash
mkdir git-lab-undo
cd git-lab-undo
git init
```

### ✔ Explanation

* `git init` creates a hidden `.git` folder that contains all Git history and metadata.
* Now this folder is a Git repository.

### ✔ Expected output

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /your/path/git-lab-undo/.git/
```

---

# 📌 **STEP 2 — Create first file and commit**

```bash
echo "line1" > app.txt
git add app.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### ✔ Explanation

* `echo "line1" > app.txt` creates the file.
* `git add app.txt` stages the file (moves it to **staging area**).
* `git commit` saves staged files into the repository history.

---

# 📌 **STEP 3 — Make a wrong commit (simulate mistake)**

```bash
echo "secret=123" > config.env
git add .
git commit -m "Added config"
```

### ❌ This commit contains secret data.

### ❌ You want to undo it (but keep the file).

---

# 📌 **STEP 4 — Undo last commit but keep changes (`--soft`)**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### ✔ Explanation

* `HEAD~1` means "one commit before the current one."
* `--soft` removes the commit **but keeps the changes stage**.

### ✔ After running soft reset:

* Commit **gone**
* `config.env` still in **staging** (`git status` will show it)

### ✔ Why is this useful?

If your commit message was wrong
or you committed to the wrong branch
— this lets you fix it without losing your work.

---

# 📌 **STEP 5 — Stage wrong file & unstage it (restore)**

Let’s simulate another mistake:

```bash
git add config.env   # Staged accidentally
```

Now unstage:

```bash
git restore --staged config.env
```

### ✔ Explanation

* `git restore --staged` removes file from staging **but does not touch your working directory**.
* File stays on disk.

This is the new replacement for the old:

```
git reset HEAD config.env
```

---

# 📌 **STEP 6 — Make a wrong commit and remove everything (`--hard`)**

Make a mistake:

```bash
echo "Wrong data" >> app.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Mistaken commit"
```

Now undo:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### ✔ Explanation (very important)

* `--hard` touches BOTH staging area **and** working directory.
* You lose: commit + changes + file edits.

⚠ **Dangerous command: irreversible unless you know how to use reflog.**

---

# 📌 **STEP 7 — Delete a file and recover using Reflog**

Delete the file:

```bash
rm app.txt
git commit -am "Deleted app"
```

Now your project is broken.

---

# 📌 **STEP 8 — Recover using `git reflog` (ultimate recovery tool)**

```bash
git reflog
```

### ✔ Explanation

Reflog shows ALL actions taken in your repo:

Example output:

```
a12c3ef HEAD@{0}: commit: Deleted app
c45b2ee HEAD@{1}: commit: Mistaken commit
8e4c1aa HEAD@{2}: commit: Initial commit
```

### ✔ Restore repo to the previous safe state

Pick the commit BEFORE delete:

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-id>
```

For example:

```bash
git reset --hard c45b2ee
```

### ✔ Explanation

This restores the entire repo EXACTLY as it looked at that commit.

---

# 🔍 **Explanation of All Undo Commands**

---

## 🔵 **1. `git restore`**

Used for **unstaging** or **discarding changed files**.

### Unstage:

```bash
git restore --staged file.txt
```

### Discard working directory changes:

```bash
git restore file.txt
```

---

## 🔵 **2. `git reset`**

Used for undoing commits.

### ✔ Soft reset

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

* Undo commit
* Keep staging + changes

---

### ✔ Mixed reset (default)

```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

* Undo commit
* Remove staging
* Keep file changes

---

### ✔ Hard reset

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

* Undo commit
* Remove staging
* Delete file changes

⚠ Dangerous.

---

## 🔵 **3. `git commit --amend`**

Fix last commit message OR add more files to last commit.

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Corrected message"
```

---

## 🔵 **4. `git reflog`**

Shows history of HEAD — used to recover lost commits.

```bash
git reflog
```

---

# 🧪 **FULL PRACTICE SET (Do this to master Undoing Work)**

Run these in order:

### **1. Make wrong commit → fix with soft reset**

### **2. Stage wrong file → restore**

### **3. Edit file wrongly → reset mixed**

### **4. Make irreversible mistake → recover with reflog**

### **5. Delete file → restore with reflog**
