Great choice 👍
Below are **real Git interview debugging questions** that companies actually ask — with **how to think**, **what to say**, and **correct commands**.

Use these to **practice explaining**, not just typing.

# 🧠 Git Interview Debugging Questions (with Answers)

---

## 1️⃣ “You committed directly to `main` by mistake. What do you do?”

### Interviewer is testing:

* Branching knowledge
* Safety

### Best answer:

> “If it’s not pushed, I create a new branch from `main`.
> If it’s already pushed, I revert the commit.”

### Commands:

```bash
# Not pushed
git switch -c feature-fix

# Already pushed
git revert HEAD
```

---

## 2️⃣ “Your changes disappeared after `git pull`. How do you recover?”

### Key concept:

* `reflog`

### Best answer:

> “I check `git reflog` to find the lost commit and recover it.”

### Commands:

```bash
git reflog
git switch -c recovery <hash>
```

---

## 3️⃣ “Explain the difference between `git reset` and `git revert`.”

### Expected answer:

> “Reset rewrites history and is only safe locally.
> Revert creates a new commit and is safe for shared branches.”

### Example:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1   # local only
git revert HEAD           # shared branches
```

---

## 4️⃣ “You’re in detached HEAD and made commits. What now?”

### Best answer:

> “I immediately create a branch to keep the commits.”

```bash
git switch -c save-work
```

---

## 5️⃣ “A PR has merge conflicts. How do you handle it?”

### Interviewer wants:

* Calm, methodical approach

### Best answer:

> “I pull the latest `main`, resolve conflicts locally, test, and push.”

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch feature
git merge origin/main
# fix conflicts
git add .
git commit
git push
```

---

## 6️⃣ “Someone force-pushed to `main`. How do you recover?”

### Key tools:

* `reflog`
* `fetch`

### Best answer:

> “I fetch, inspect history, and reset to the correct commit if needed.”

```bash
git fetch
git reflog
git reset --hard origin/main
```

---

## 7️⃣ “How do you undo a pushed commit that broke production?”

### Correct mindset:

* Safety first

### Best answer:

> “I use `git revert` to safely undo the commit.”

```bash
git revert <bad-commit>
git push
```

---

## 8️⃣ “Why is Git refusing to commit due to line endings?”

### Expected knowledge:

* `autocrlf`
* `safecrlf`

### Best answer:

> “Git detected unsafe CRLF/LF conversions. I normalize the file.”

```bash
sed -i 's/\r$//' file
git add file
git commit
```

---

## 9️⃣ “Your PR has too many messy commits. What do you do?”

### Interviewer expects:

* `rebase -i`

### Best answer:

> “I squash commits using interactive rebase before merging.”

```bash
git rebase -i origin/main
```

---

## 🔟 “How do you check what exactly is inside a commit?”

### Key concept:

* Git objects

### Best answer:

> “I use `git show` or `git cat-file`.”

```bash
git show <hash>
git cat-file -p <hash>
```

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ “Explain fast-forward vs merge commit.”

### Strong answer:

> “Fast-forward moves the branch pointer forward without a merge commit when histories haven’t diverged.”

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ “How do you fix a wrong remote URL?”

```bash
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin <url>
```

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ “What’s your Git safety checklist?”

### Excellent answer:

> * Check `git status`
> * Avoid force-push
> * Prefer revert over reset
> * Use reflog when in doubt

---

## 🧠 How to answer in interviews (important)

Say **why**, not just **how**:

❌ *“I run git reset.”*
✅ *“I choose revert because it preserves history on shared branches.”*

---

## 🎯 Final Interview Tip

If you get stuck, say:

> “I’d inspect `git status` and `git log` first.”

Interviewers love that.

Great 👍
Below are **advanced Git internals interview questions** with **clear, correct answers**. These focus on how Git *actually works under the hood* and are commonly used for senior / system-level interviews.

---

# 🧠 Advanced Git Internals Interview Questions

---

## 1️⃣ What is a Git object?

**Answer:**
A Git object is a compressed, immutable data structure stored in `.git/objects`.
There are **four types**:

* **blob** – file contents
* **tree** – directory structure
* **commit** – snapshot + metadata
* **tag** – named reference to a commit

---

## 2️⃣ How does Git store a file internally?

**Answer:**
Git stores the **contents**, not the filename, as a **blob object**.
The filename and permissions are stored in a **tree object**.

> Two identical files → one blob (content-addressed storage).

---

## 3️⃣ Explain how a commit is structured internally

**Answer:**
A commit object contains:

* A **tree hash** (snapshot of the repo)
* **Parent commit hash(es)**
* Author & committer info
* Commit message

Commits form a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**.

---

## 4️⃣ What happens when you run `git add`?

**Answer:**

* Git creates **blob objects** for file contents
* Stores them in `.git/objects`
* Updates the **index (staging area)**

No commit is created yet.

---

## 5️⃣ What happens when you run `git commit`?

**Answer:**

* Git creates a **tree object** from the index
* Creates a **commit object** pointing to that tree
* Moves `HEAD` and the current branch pointer

---

## 6️⃣ What is `HEAD`, really?

**Answer:**
`HEAD` is a **reference** that usually points to a branch, which then points to a commit.

* Normal state → `HEAD → branch → commit`
* Detached HEAD → `HEAD → commit`

---

## 7️⃣ Why are Git hashes reliable?

**Answer:**

* Git uses **SHA-1** (and SHA-256 in newer setups)
* Hash includes:

  * object type
  * size
  * content

Any change produces a **different hash**, ensuring integrity.

---

## 8️⃣ What is the Git index (staging area)?

**Answer:**
The index is a **binary file** (`.git/index`) that represents:

* The exact contents of the *next commit*
* A middle layer between working tree and repository

---

## 9️⃣ What’s the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase` internally?

**Merge**

* Creates a **new commit**
* Has **multiple parents**
* Preserves history

**Rebase**

* Replays commits
* Creates **new commit hashes**
* Rewrites history

---

## 🔟 What is a fast-forward merge internally?

**Answer:**
Git simply moves the branch pointer forward.
No new commit is created.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ How does Git detect renames?

**Answer:**
Git does **not store renames explicitly**.
It detects them heuristically by:

* Comparing blob similarity
* During diff or merge operations

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ What is `git reflog` and where is it stored?

**Answer:**
Reflog records **updates to references** (like `HEAD`).

Stored in:

```text
.git/logs/HEAD
.git/logs/refs/
```

Used for recovery.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ What are packfiles?

**Answer:**
Packfiles store many objects efficiently by:

* Delta compression
* Reducing disk space
* Speeding up network transfers

Created by:

```bash
git gc
```

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ What happens during `git clone`?

**Answer:**

* Creates `.git`
* Downloads packfiles
* Sets up remote tracking branches
* Checks out default branch

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ How does Git know what changed?

**Answer:**
Git compares:

* Working tree vs index
* Index vs last commit

It never tracks changes line-by-line until diff time.

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ What is an annotated tag internally?

**Answer:**
An annotated tag is a **tag object** that:

* Points to a commit
* Contains metadata (tagger, message)

Lightweight tags are just refs.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ What is a shallow clone?

**Answer:**
A clone with limited history:

```bash
git clone --depth=1
```

* Faster
* Smaller
* Limited history operations

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ Why is Git called “content-addressable”?

**Answer:**
Objects are named by the **hash of their contents**, not by location or filename.

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ What is the object database?

**Answer:**
The object database is `.git/objects`, storing all blobs, trees, commits, and tags.

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ How would you inspect Git internals manually?

**Answer:**

```bash
git cat-file -t <hash>
git cat-file -p <hash>
git ls-tree <tree-hash>
```

---
